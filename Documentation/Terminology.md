# Notation
I am using the same notation at the PowerISA.
- RT, RA, R1 refer to the General Purpose Registers.
- FRT, FRA, FR1 refer to the Floating-Point Registers.
- FRTp, FRAp, FRBp refer to an even-odd pair of Floating-Point Registers
- VRT, VRA, VR1 refer to Vector Registers
- Byte 0 is the Most Significatn Byte (MSB)
- 8LS refers to 8 bytes Load / Store
