# List of problems you should keep in mind when contributing:
- Declare and assign a signal on one line: `logic test = ...;`
- Always make sure you have proper integer overflow in your Python verification Code
- If you use a BigEndian ISA use BigEndian Vectors
- When writing a bash for loop `for item in $array`, do not forget about the `$`
